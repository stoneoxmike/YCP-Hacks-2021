# YCP-Hacks-2021
This project was completed for YCP Hacks in 2021. The goal was to have a stepper motor synthesizer controlled by a MIDI input port. This allows for either manual mixes of MIDI files or a MIDI controller such as a keyboard to control the stepper motors. There is also an audio visualizer in the form of an LED matrix.
# Files
#### MIDI_Stepper_V1.ino - This is the main Arduino Sketch for an Arduino MEGA
#### pitches.h - This file contains the relations of MIDI note pitch to stepper motor speed in microseconds
#### Africa Edit Export 1.mid - This is an example MIDI file with a 4 channel mix of Africa, Star Wars, and Pirates of the Caribbean
